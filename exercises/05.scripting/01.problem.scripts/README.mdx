# Scripts

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/scripting/javascript-in-remix-from-optional-to-essential" />

🧝‍♂️ I removed JavaScript script tags from <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />
because they are unnecessary. Everything we've done so far works whether
JavaScript is running in the browser or not. Go ahead and try it out. Open up
the app (in a new tab) and check the network tab. You'll notice there's no
JavaScript loaded by the application. Click around and submit forms and you'll
find that everything works as expected. The browser has been able to do this
navigation and form submission stuff since the very beginning and it's pretty
good at it.

But now, we've actually got some things we want to do with client-side
JavaScript, so we want to add it back.

👨‍💼 That's right, we're wanting to start adding some client-side pending UI,
prefetching, and eventually even optimistic UI. It's going to be great. But
we'll need JavaScript on the client to do it.

So, let's add the `<Scripts />` component back. We'll also want to add a couple
other components, but don't worry... 🐨 Kody will be there to tell you what to
do.
