🧝‍♂️ Thanks for adding that back. Those development components will be really nice
to have.

👨‍💼 Great work! You should be able to tell now that the page transitions are a
bit smoother and don't trigger full-page reloads. Unfortunately, that also means
the user won't get feedback of their navigations and form submissions if they
take some time. We'll definitely want to come along later and add some pending
UI. But we've got other problems to deal with first.
