# Meta Overrides

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/search-engine-optimization/dynamic-metadata-for-different-routes" />

👨‍💼 We want to be able to override the `title` and `description` for certain
pages. Specifically, we want <LinkToApp to="/users/kody" /> to have the
following meta:

- **Title**: Profile | Epic Notes
- **Description**: Checkout this Profile on Epic Notes

To do this, we'll need to use
Remix's conventional `meta` export for nested routes in combination with its
`<Meta />` component.

As a reminder, here's what the API looks like:

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.tsx
import { type MetaFunction } from '@remix-run/react'

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
	return [
		{ title: 'Sandwich Shop' },
		{ name: 'description', content: 'Fill your tummy with something yummy' },
	]
}
```
