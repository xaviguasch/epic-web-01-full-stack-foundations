# Error Bubbling

👨‍💼 Great! Now we've got really nice consistency with our errors!

<callout-success class="important">
	Also, thanks to nested routing, our errors for the notes are contextual!
</callout-success>

Go ahead and add this to the
loader in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId.tsx" />:

```tsx
if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
	throw new Error('Oh no!')
}
```

You'll notice that even though the note loader itself threw an error, the rest
of the app is completely functional. Very good UX!

But we just realized one major issue we need to deal with next...
