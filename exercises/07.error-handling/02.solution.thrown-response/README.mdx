👨‍💼 Thanks a lot! This is looking much better than before and our users are

🧝‍♂️ I've been working on a handy abstraction for this, which you'll be able to
use next!

💯 If you've got extra time, you can try and build a useful abstraction
yourself before moving on to the next step. You
can <DiffLink app1="playground" app2={1}>check your progress</DiffLink> or
simply <DiffLink>check Kellie's solution</DiffLink>.
