# Root ErrorBoundary

👨‍💼 Great, now we have an error boundary that can serve as a backup if we forget
to add an error boundary elsewhere in our app and we can also handle errors in
the root of our app as well. This is a much better user experience!

💯 If you've got extra time, go ahead and add another route and throw an error
in it to make sure the error bubbling is working.
