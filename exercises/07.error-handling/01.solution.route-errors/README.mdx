👨‍💼 Great job! Now we have a much better experience when errors occur.

And what's more, the `Response` we've been throwing is also handled by the
`ErrorBoundary` as well! Try visiting a user that doesn't exist
like <LinkToApp to="/users/not_kody" />.

But we can do a bit better for the UX of these kinds of errors...
