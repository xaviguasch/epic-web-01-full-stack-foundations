# Bundling CSS

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/styling/bundling-css-in-remix" />

👨‍💼 While we build out our application, we'll probably have some need to use a
component library that requires some CSS be added to the application. One or two
of these are not a big deal, but our `root.tsx` `links` export could get pretty
big if we do this for a lot of components like this.

So, Remix allows you to import CSS files that are bundled automatically. It's
pretty simple:

```tsx
import stylesheetUrl from './styles1.css' // <-- you use the URL in the links export
import './styles2.css' // <-- this will be bundled
```

So, if you just import the CSS file without an "import clause" (the
`stylesheetUrl` variable in the example above), it will be bundled for you.

However, we are still responsible for everything on the page between the
`<html>` and the `</html>` tags, so if we want the bundled CSS file on the page
then we need to make sure we add it to the links. Remix gives us access to that
URL through a special package called `@remix-run/css-bundle`:

```tsx
import './styles2.css'
import './styles3.css'
import { cssBundleHref } from '@remix-run/css-bundle'
```

The contents of `styles2.css` and `styles3.css` will appear within the file that
is referenced by `cssBundleHref`. So, we can add that to our `links` export.

<callout-info>
	If you don't have any such imports, then `cssBundleHref` will (correctly) be
	`undefined` so the browser doesn't load an empty file, so you'll want to
	handle that case.
</callout-info>

🧝‍♂️ I've added an import to a static CSS file just to test that things work in
this exercise:

<CodeFile
	file="app/root.tsx"
	range="6-10"
	highlight="9"
	nocopy
	buttons="playground"
/>
