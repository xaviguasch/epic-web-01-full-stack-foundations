👨‍💼 Awesome work.

🦉 You may be wondering why we're using the `links` export with the `<Links />`
component instead of just adding a `<link>` tag directly inside our `<head>`. It
would definitely work that way, however it's a good idea to get in the habit of
using the `links` export because you'll get a little more help from TypeScript
and when you're in other routes, you can't just add a `<link>` to the `<head>`
because it's not there. We'll get into this more later.
