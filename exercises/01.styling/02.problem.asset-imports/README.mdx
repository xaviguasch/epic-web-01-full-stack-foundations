# Asset Imports

üë®‚Äçüíº Unfortunately, we never know when we're going to want to change our favicon,
so our caching strategy has to reflect that. We can't just tell the browser to
cache it forever, so every hour or so the browser has to download the favicon
again even if it is unchanged.

One solution would be to cache it for a long time and then whenever we change
the icon, we could add something to the query string to "bust the cache." Like
this:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg?v=2" />
```

But that is annoying and error prone. Wouldn't it be cool if a tool did that for
us? Yes, it would. And Remix can do that.

So, instead of hard-coding the URL for the favicon, we can "import" the asset
and Remix will take care of getting it into our `public` directory and give us
the URL to it. As a part of this process it will add a piece to the filename
that "fingerprints" the file. So, if we change the favicon, the URL will change
and the browser will download the new one. And we don't have to think about it!

Let's do this. üê® So first you'll need to move the `favicon.svg`
from <InlineFile file="public/favicon.svg" /> to <InlineFile file="app/assets/favicon.svg" />.

Then, in <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" />, we can import it like this:

```tsx
import faviconAssetUrl from './assets/favicon.svg'
```

And use `faviconAssetUrl` instead of the hard-coded URL.
