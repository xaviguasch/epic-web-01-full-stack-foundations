👨‍💼 Great! Isn't that nice and declarative? Edge cases are handled in a nice and
declarative way. We still have much to dive into with giving the user a better
experience, which is the subject of the next exercise, but for now our form is
functioning well!

🦉 It's important to note that we're using the HTTP method `POST` instead of
`DELETE` for this submission. It does technically work with `DELETE`, but in a
limited capacity. We'll talk more about this in the next exercise as well, but
I'll just leave you with this gem: there are only two valid HTTP methods allowed
in HTML forms: `GET` and `POST`.

We're still not quite done here, let's improve this a bit more.
