# Intent

👨‍💼 Our `action` for the delete button is pretty simple. In the future we'll
probably add a "favorite" button where users can mark a note as a favorite, but
our `action` only handles deleting a note.

To help us to distinguish the user's preferred action, we'll use a common
pattern of adding a `name` and `value` to the delete button:

```html
<button type="submit" name="intent" value="delete">Delete</button>
```

🤯 yes, it's true. Submit buttons are form controls, just like inputs, and can
therefore have names and values. From there you can get the intent from the
request form data and handle it accordingly.

Doing things this way will also ensure the request is performed properly.
