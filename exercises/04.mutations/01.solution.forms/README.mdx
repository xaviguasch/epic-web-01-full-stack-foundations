# Forms

👨‍💼 Great! With the form in place (and preloaded with the existing note's data)
you can submit the form and you'll get a Remix error telling you that you've
need an `action` before you can submit.

I'll mention also that if you use a `<form>` instead of a `<Form>`, the
form will submit, but
[you get a 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code](https://mdn.io/405). That
response is given to us from Remix because our route doesn't support handling
anything but `GET` requests. That's where actions come into play!
