# Button Forms

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/mutations/button-forms-data" />

ü¶â Folks who are used to building client-side focused applications may be
familiar with a button triggering a fetch request:

```tsx
function DeployTheSocks() {
	return (
		<button
			onClick={() => {
				fetch('/api/deploy-the-socks', { method: 'POST' })
			}}
		>
			Deploy the socks!
		</button>
	)
}
```

This works, but of course there are a lot of considerations you need to take
into account. For example:

- What if the user clicks the button twice?
- What if the user clicks the button while the request is still in flight?
- What if the user clicks the button while the request is still in flight, and
  then navigates away from the page?
- What if the request fails?
- What if the user clicks the button twice, but the second response returns
  first?

The edge cases are... numerous. Once you've factored all that in, you're left
with code that's tricky to manage.

There's a better way. Make the button a form, and let the browser (or your
browser emulator, Remix (we'll talk about this more soon)) handle the edge cases
for you. It's a nice and declarative API.

üë®‚Äçüíº We want to make the Delete button functional. So you're going to need to wrap
the button in a form and add an action.

	We don't have a way to create new notes yet, so if you delete all the notes,
	you can stop and start the server again and all the notes will be back.
