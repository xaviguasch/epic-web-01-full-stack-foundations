üë®‚Äçüíº Great! Now the basic functionality is there.

You know what's _really_ cool? You didn't have to do anything to get the data
updated in the app. As soon as the note is updated in your action, the data in
the app is automatically updated as well! This is because Remix is emulating the
browser for us, and the browser would have completely refreshed the page which
effectively gives us the latest data. This is a really powerful feature of
Remix and we'll discuss it more later.

Another important thing to note is that this form works without any client-side
JavaScript. That's actually how we get away with not needing to manage state!
This is a huge boost to developer productivity and user experience. Take a look
at YouTube.com sometime on a throttled network and notice that the input field
is not rendered until after a huge amount of JavaScript shows up, and even when
it is rendered, it doesn't work until even more JavaScript shows up. This is
a really bad UX that could be avoided if they simply leveraged the platform for
the search input.

For now, let's tidy it up a bit.
