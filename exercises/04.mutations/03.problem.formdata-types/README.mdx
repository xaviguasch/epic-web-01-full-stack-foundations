# FormData Types

ðŸ¦‰ An important thing to know about `request.formData` is the values stored in
it can have three different types:

- `null` - the value doesn't exist in the form data at all
- `string` - This applies to inputs (including checkboxes and radio buttons),
  textareas, and select elements.
- `File` - This applies to file inputs.

It's impossible for us to prevent users from submitting invalid data (users can
change the types in our form using the browser devtools or even submit the form
using a tool like Postman). But we know that if the data is invalid, we don't
want to proceed with the form submission, and frankly we can't really offer any
recourse for the user, so we can simply throw an error which we can handle as
gracefully as possible.

You can test this out by changing the form to have a typo. Like changing `name`
of the `title` to `title2` for example. Then submit the request and make sure
the response is what you expect.
