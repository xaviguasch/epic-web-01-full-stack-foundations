# Handle Missing Data

👨‍💼 Terrific! Well done. Now we're handling data that's missing (and 🦺 Lily the
Life Jacket is happy our types are happy too). Like I said, we'll handle the
error UI in another exercise, but this is a good start.

🧝‍♂️ I'm going to make a few changes for you. I'll add a (non-functional) delete
button and a (functional) edit link to the existing note page. The edit link
takes users to a new note edit route which I made as well. All it has in there
is a JSON string of the note data. I'm also going to be adding a few components
to make things look nice.

If you've got some extra time, feel free to do this yourself. Or you can
simply <DiffLink>check my changes</DiffLink>.
