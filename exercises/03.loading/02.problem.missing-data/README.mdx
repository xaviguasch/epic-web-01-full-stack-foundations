# Handle Missing Data

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/loading/handling-error-messages-and-status-codes-in-web-development" />

üë®‚Äçüíº One of our Quality Assurance folks discovered an issue. If you go to a user
that does not exist, the app crashes. For example,
try this one: <LinkToApp to="/users/i-do-not-exist" /> üò¨

We had to ignore some TypeScript errors with `// @ts-expect-error` which should
have tipped us off about this problem... ü¶∫ Lily the life jacket is not amused.

We need to handle this case. That should be a `404` error. So after trying to
get the `user` from the database, you're going to need to check whether the
returned `user` exists. If they don't, then you should throw a `404` error.
Here's an example how you do that:

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.$id.tsx
export async function loader({ params }) {
	const sandwich = await db.sandwich.findFirst({
		where: { id: params.id },
	})

	if (!sandwich) {
		throw new Response('Sandwich not found', { status: 404 })
	}

	return json({ sandwich })
}
```

Hmmm... `throw` a response!? How weird is that? Well, in Remix it's exactly how
you solve this problem. It allows you to easily exit code flow and send a
response right away. You can even put it into a utility function:

{/* TODO: add types and make this an assertion function that infers and maintains the typing of sandwich. Possibly even make it generic. */}

```tsx filename=utils.ts
function assertDefined<Value>(
	value: Value | null | undefined,
): asserts value is Value {
	if (value === undefined || value === null) {
		throw new Response('Not found', { status: 404 })
	}
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/sandwiches.$id.tsx
export async function loader({ params }) {
	const sandwich = await db.sandwich.findFirst({
		where: { id: params.id },
	})

	assertDefined(sandwich)

	return json({ sandwich })
}
```

Remix will handle catching the response for us and send the response we threw
along. But it does so in a special way which we'll get to in a future exercise.
For now, just handling the error with a proper status code is enough.

So please handle possible missing data in the loaders of the profile, note list,
and note routes.
