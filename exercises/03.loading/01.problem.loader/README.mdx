# Loaders

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/full-stack-foundations/loading/loading-data-to-your-database" />

👨‍💼 Now that our routing is all taken care of, Kellie (your coworker 🧝‍♂️) has
taken some time to make the app look a little bit nicer and now you need to add
some data loading.

🧝‍♂️ I've also created a temporary fake database for us to use until we get around
to actually putting together a real database in the future. You can find it in
the `app/utils/db.server.ts` file if you want to, but don't worry about it
because Marty (the moneybag 💰) will give you all the code you need to work with
it as it's not really necessary for what you're learning today.

🧝‍♂️ I've also added a user with some notes in the database by default as well.
The username is `kody` and I've added a link for Kody's notes on the home page
in the top right corner to make it easier for you to get to his first note which
can be found at <LinkToApp to="/users/kody/notes/d27a197e" />.

	The tool we're using is [@mswjs/data](https://github.com/mswjs/data) which you
	may find useful in other contexts. But again, don't worry too much about it.
	We'll get to the real database stuff in another workshop.

👨‍💼 Great, with that out of the way, it's time for us to actually start loading
data. Based on what you learned in the background for this exercise, you should
be familiar with the conventions necessary to load data into the UI and the
emoji will be there to guide you along as you go. We're going to be loading data
on the profile, list of notes, and note page.

🐨 All the instructions for this exercise will be in the files themselves. You
can go through them in any order. They will be pretty similar to each other.

	Don't forget you can use the "Files" menu below to open the files necessary
	for this workshop.

	And if you *really* get stuck, you can always look at the diff tab to see what
	you're missing.
