# Routes

There's a lot more to learn about routing in Remix. Your best friend is the
`npx remix routes` command which will help you figure out how your routes are
structured based on your file structure.

The key concepts are:

1. Layout Nesting
2. URL Nesting

Once you nail those two concepts, then routing in Remix will be much more
straightforward.

## Route Module Exports

There are a number of things we can export from each of these routes. You will
recall from the last exercise that we exported a `links` function from
the <InlineFile file="app/root.tsx" /> file. We can export that from each of
these routes as well. This has the benefit of allowing us to provide specific
links to render when the route is active which will later be removed when the
user navigates away.

This has great implications for CSS that you want applied only on specific
pages. Both in the sense that we can reduce the amount of CSS loaded on
individual pages, but also in the sense that CSS can be scoped to specific
routes greatly reducing unexpected clashes and making everything much more
predictable.

Remix also has the ability to preload everything in our links if we want to
preload a page as the user uses the site, but we'll get to that later.
